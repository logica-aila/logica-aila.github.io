    <title>Assistant Professorship (W2tt) for Pure Mathematics</title>
    <number>1</number>
    <type>Tenure/Permanent</type>
    <description>
        The Department of Mathematics at Technical University of Darmstadt is renowned for its excellent research and teaching. With a strong commitment to innovation and the values of TU Darmstadt, the department covers a wide range of mathematical disciplines, including pure, applied, and computer-oriented mathematics. Our faculty members are internationally recognized in their respective fields and promote a modern inclusive research community. We maintain strong interdisciplinary and international collaborations, as well as collaborations within the context of the Rhine-Main Universities (RMU). With the advertised professorship, we aim to strengthen and expand our efforts in this regard.

        As part of its commitment to the interdisciplinary environment of TU Darmstadt, the department provides service-teaching for other technical departments. Particularly relevant for the advertised professorship is that the education of students in the formal foundations of computer science is provided by the Department of Mathematics.

        The Department of Mathematics at TU Darmstadt seeks candidates at the earliest possible date (no later than October 2025) for an assistant professorship (W2 with tenure track) for Pure Mathematics.

        The research focus of the professorship should be in one of the areas:

        Discrete algorithmic mathematics,
        Logic with connections to theoretical computer science, or
        Graph theory/combinatorics.

        The department places great value on engagement in teaching within the mathematics programs and mathematical education for students of other departments. Therefore, the professorship should also contribute to teaching with a high level of commitment by participating in the mathematics programs and lectures on formal foundations of computer science.

        Furthermore, participation in the department's third-party funding efforts in the RMU context (particularly relating to the DAIS initiative https://dais.rhein-main-universitaeten.de/) is expected.

        If you have any questions about this position, please contact Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Pascal Schweitzer via email at schweitzer@mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de.

    <description>
        The LaBRI research lab based at the University of Bordeaux is currently seeking highly 
        motivated candidates with excellent academic records and experience in knowledge 
        representation and reasoning (esp. ontologies, description logics, inconsistency
        and uncertainty handling), database theory, data quality and/or logic in CS to join 
        the Ratio team (ratio.labri.fr/) and take part in the INTENDED AI Chair (intended.labri.fr). 

        We currently have an opening for a 13-month postdoc position.The recruited person will 
        collaborate with myself and other project members on foundational research related to the 
        project's overall theme of developing principled methods for handling imperfect 
        (inconsistent, inconsistent, and/or uncertain) data, by exploiting declarative knowledge 
        and reasoning.  Generally speaking, this will involve the definition of formal frameworks 
        for repairing and querying imperfect data, the study of the computational complexity of the 
        associated reasoning tasks, and the development of reasoning algorithms (note that 
        implementation of developed algorithms is not required, but could be undertaken if desired).

        The precise research topics can be adapted to some degree to take into account the specific 
        background and interests of the hired researcher, so brilliant candidates with an interest for 
        the overall project topic should not hesitate to apply!

    <description>
        The Logic Uncertainty Computation and Information (LUCI) Lab at the University of Milan is seeking applications for   
        Three 2-year postdoctoral positions 
        funded by the Italian Ministry of University and Research (MUR) under the FIS1 Advanced Grant Reasoning with Data (ReDa)  led by Hykel Hosni 

        Deadline for application: 4 June 2024 
        Expected starting date:  1 September 2024 (negotiable)

        The appointments. Appointments will be made in either of the work packages below. Please specify in your application which WP would suit you best. Each candidate can put in one application only.  There are no teaching duties attached to the posts, and proficiency in Italian is not required. 
        Work package 1:  Non-monotonic formalisation of data-driven inference.
        The appointee is expected to work on the identification of suitable constraints for consequence relations capable of expressing salient patterns of data-driven inference. (The background and general idea are discussed informally here https://projects.illc.uva.nl/lgc/seminar/2023/03/lira-session-hykel-hosni/) . 
        Candidates for this work package must have a strong background in logic, acquired through a Master and a PhD in any of the relevant paths, including and possibly combining, Mathematics, Philosophy, and Computer Science. Familiarity with the preferential approach to nonmonotonic reasoning is a plus. Applicants are also expected to be conversant with elementary probability and statistics. 
        Work package 2:  Logic for the methodology of data-intensive and AI-driven science
        The appointee is expected to identify suitable roles for logical methods in the construction of a scientific methodology capable of encompassing AI-driven science. Logicians have traditionally followed Tarski in restricting the applicability of logic to the methodology of deductive sciences. In the age of data-intensive and machine-learning-driven science, this is overly restrictive both for logic and for science. To overcome this, the appointee will pin down patterns reasoning from any area of data-intensive and AI-driven science (preferably biology) and work towards their logical formalisation.
        Candidates for this work package must have a strong background in logic or philosophy of science, preferably both, acquired through a Master and a PhD in any of the relevant subject. Familiarity with the methodological and epistemological questions revolving around “big data” are a definite plus. Applicants are also expected to be conversant with the current literature on AI for scientific research, including explainable AI. Familiarity with the history of logic from Boole onwards is desirable.
        Work package 3:  The construction of probabilistic evidence in rare cancers
        The successful candidate is expected to work on methodologically rigorous approaches to the personalisation of probability in clinical decision-making about rare cancers. The key goal is to put forward principled ways to come up with patient-specific, meaningful, probabilities from data about “the average patient” arising in clinical studies. Since this work package will contribute to developing decision-theoretic tools to be used at the patient's bedside, the appointed researcher will be based at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori in Milan, and will work in close collaboration with the Biostatistics for Clinical Research, Sarcomas, and Head-and-Neck Cancers Units.   
        Applicants for this WP must have a strong background in medical statistics, clinical epidemiology and probability applied to those fields, acquired through any relevant postgraduate degree. Familiarity with medical decision making and the construction of probabilistic and statistical evidence is a definite plus.

    <title>PhD in Proof Theory (Brighton, UK)</title>
    <number>1</number>
    <type> PhD </type>
    <description>
    The Department of Informatics at the University of Sussex (Brighton, UK) invites applications for highly motivated candidates interested in PhD positions in Logic (Proof Theory).
    The ideal candidate has a Master's degree in Mathematics, Computer Science or Philosophy with experience in Logic (preferably in Proof Theory). 
    The position has a duration of 3.5 years ideally starting in September 2024.
    The hired candidate will be part of the Foundations of Software Systems group ( https://www.sussex.ac.uk/foss/ ), a dynamic group in Theoretical Computer Science which is currently growing and has recently hired various young researchers.

    The project aims at studying the problem of proof equivalence and its applications.
    The problem of proof equivalence, which recently came to the forefront after the discovery of the 24th Hilbert problem, deals with deciding whether two logical arguments should be considered as the same proof, providing theoretical foundations for notions of program equivalences.
    To this end, the project will investigate novel notions of proof equivalence in various logical systems through the lens of proof theory. Emphasis will be given to the study of proof systems allowing canonical representations of proofs (e.g., Hughes' combinatorial proofs and Girard's proof nets). Moreover, the project plans to establish connections between proof equivalence and games, both in the sense of dialogical games (Lorenz and Lorenzen) and game semantics (Abramsky, Hyland and Ong).
    According to the interest of the candidate, applications to interoperability and usability of automated theorem prover and proof assistant, or applications to the theory of programming languages may be investigated.


    Applicants interested in the study of proof theory are encouraged to get in touch with Dr. Matteo Acclavio for additional information and informal inquiries.
